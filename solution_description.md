##  Chapter 2 Introduction to Users and Administrators 

Nurses, physicians, registrars, coders, and report writers all log in to Epic for a variety of tasks. Everyone
who logs in to Epic is called a user. Users perform a variety of tasks using different parts of the Epic
system.

In this class, it will be helpful to differentiate between users who perform healthcare tasks in the system
and administrators who build content to meet users needs. For Cogito, administrative tasks include
creating dashboards and reports.

By the End of This Lesson, You Will Be Able To...
1. Log in to Hyperspace
2.  Explain the difference between a user and an administrator


 
##  Cogito Users and administrators 

### Users

**Users** log in to Epic to do their jobs. The steps that a user takes in Epic are referred to as a workflow. For
example, a clinician might open their schedule, review a patients medical history, open the patients chart,
place an order, and sign a note. Different users have different workflows.

### User Workflows
Users navigate to different activities in Hyperspace when completing their **workflows**. A scheduler can use
the Appts activity to create a new appointment, a clinician can review messages from the In Basket activity,
and a report writer can modify report settings from the Analytics Catalog activity.

### Epic Menu 

The Epic menu contains all the activities a user has access to. The Epic search (under the Epic button) or
the Assistant Bar (at the top of Hyperspace) are the most efficient ways to launch a Hyperspace activity.

### Hyperspace

**Hyperspace** is Epics front‚Äêuser interface, accessed on the Hyperdrive client. 
It is what most users think of as **Epic**. 
Users log in to Hyperspace to complete their workflows and do their jobs. 
Administrators also log in to Hyperspace to test and troubleshoot build.

### Hyperspace and Epics Database

**Chronicles** is Epics database management system, often referred to as **the database.** The data that users
access in **Hyperspace** lives in **Chronicles**. When a user logs in to Hyperspace and opens a patients chart,
Hyperspace is requesting data from **Chronicles**. When a user documents information in a patients chart,
they are saving data to **Chronicles**.
