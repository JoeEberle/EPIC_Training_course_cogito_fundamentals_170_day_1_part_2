##  Chapter 2 Introduction to Users and Administrators 

Nurses, physicians, registrars, coders, and report writers all log in to Epic for a variety of tasks. Everyone
who logs in to Epic is called a user. Users perform a variety of tasks using different parts of the Epic
system.

In this class, it will be helpful to differentiate between users who perform healthcare tasks in the system
and administrators who build content to meet users needs. For Cogito, administrative tasks include
creating dashboards and reports.

1. Log in to Hyperspace
2.  Explain the difference between a user and an administrator
